# eikonal

OpenFOAM solvers for Eikonal equation.

The solvers can be used within both OpenFOAM-v2.3.x and OpenFOAM-v2112.

-The folder "cylinder Re=150, M=0.2" contains configurations files to run eikonal solver for the test
case described in Sec. 4.1.1 of Ref.[1]. eikonal solver generates alpha field to be included in 0 folder
in the case reported in caafom solver (https://github.com/vdalessa/caafoam/tree/master/cylinder%20Re%3D150%2C%20M%3D0.2)
